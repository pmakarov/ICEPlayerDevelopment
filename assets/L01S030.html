<p>The hiring process should begin long before a position is open. The following tips are activities that you should be completing at all times:</p>
     	<ul>
        	<li>Ensure position descriptions are systematically reviewed and updated for currency, accuracy and relevance.</li>
            <li>Keep up a working relationship with your Human Resources Office or representative. Pay attention to announcements and communications from them and interact with them when possible.</li>
            <li>Keep in touch with your subordinates and peers so you are aware of possible future vacancies.</li>
         </ul>
